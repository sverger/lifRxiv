# lifRxiv
Small scripts to: 
- extract and save images from .lif files (Leica confocal microscope file format) into .tif file
- create a montage image (single image made of vignettes) of all the images contained in a .lif file, as well as a text file containing all the names of the images contained in the .lif file. 
The goal is to allow a compression of the .lif file (for exemple .zip) to reduce disk space use and still have a quick acces (preview) to the file content without having to un compress them.
